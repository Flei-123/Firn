//! **Round 80 — the target machine.**
//!
//! Up to round 79 there was exactly ONE machine: x86-64. It was not written
//! anywhere, because it did not have to be — every place that produced
//! machine code produced that one. That is precisely what made Firn a
//! one-machine language: the boundary between the intermediate
//! representation and the machine was not drawn, it was only *believed*.
//!
//! This file draws it. It holds
//!
//!   * which machine the current compilation is for (`--target=`),
//!   * the two names of the assembler and the linker that belong to it,
//!   * the small handful of assembler directives whose MEANING differs
//!     between the two ports of GNU as (`.align` counts bytes on x86 and
//!     powers of two on AArch64 — the same line would mean something else).
//!
//! Everything else about a machine lives in its code generator
//! (`codegen_x86.rs`, `codegen_a64.rs`) and in `syscalls.rs`.
//!
//! **The x86-64 path must not change.** Every function here answers for
//! `Target::X86_64` exactly what stood in the source before, character for
//! character; the aarch64 answers are the additions.
